This took me a while to complete but getting the basics down and not thinking too much about it; it all came together for me. It helps to think of a small need and build on top of that to get your idea out there.

My ideas for a project kept changing but once I had one and did basic CRUD functionality other features started to come to mind and was fun to work on!
