I started school earlier this year, and I was on track to finish by the end of 2017. I had my plan mapped out some sections of the course took a little longer than normal, but I was making great progress. I wanted to finish and start a ew career in full stack development. I was so close I started feeling anxious about gradutating.

My schedule was perfect between work, the kids, and school; I was doing great! Until life happened.

I started getting sick, and for about several days I thought I had strep. So, I did not work or code for those days. When I started feeling better I went back to work and started getting back in my routine. Then, I started feeling my stress headaches coming back again, and my eye was doing some weird things like wondering on its own!

I do not have a lazy eye, so I figured I should go to the ER now!

After spending a full day in the hosipital and after all my scans and tests. I found out I had an **aneurysm**.

I was in shock.

They scheduled my nuero surgery the following morning. 

After surgery, my doctor said no work, no school, no nothing for a full month.
I could not see myself not coding for an entire month!

My body was so tired I could barely get out of bed without help.
I recovered perfectly, but my eye was not the same. My doctors said it may never come back because of my optic nerves were severly damaged.

Hearing that was hard, but I had to keep living my life. So once I was able to go back to work. Slowly I started getting my life back, with one eye and all.

I started coding coding, which was hard. One month is a very long time, but it was like riding a bicycle! :)

Needless to say, life is going to happen; events will get in your way of your goals. Your jouney may take longer than expected but as long as you finish what you started.

You just have to learn to adjust and keep moving, and keep coding! ;)
