I finished my undergrad with a Bachelor of Science degree in Law/Criminal Justice. After graduation I took some time off and traveled Europe. During that time I was able to experience life and find out what I am truley good at. I found myself solving problems by looking at the end goal and finding the quickest route to achieve that goal. I found that I enjoyed being creative through theatre and the arts. With this information I googled jobs that are creative and can solve problems. 


Then software development appeared! I thought this was right where I want to be. I could learn how to create something out of nothing!!! I was so excited to start learning. After I came back from Europe I took a few jobs in IT to learn the many apecs of computers. After being in IT for about six months I started teahcing myself Python. A year goes by and I felt like I was not getting anywhere. So I decided to google schools in my area but not traditional schooling; lets face it nobody wants to do that again!

I then googled schools for programming and eventually found a school that fits my learning requirements for myself and fits my schedule...The Flatiron School. So now i am here wanting to create a functioning application for a business or for people. I find this process to be the most rewarding but yet painful process I have ever expeienced in my life...but I also love it!!! :)


Happy Coding! :)
