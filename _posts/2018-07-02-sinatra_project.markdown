For my project I built a Todo App.
This app took me longer than it should. I got side tracked with life in general and should have stayed focused. I had to remember most of the curriculum but use your resources! 

Flatiron has great mentors your tech advisor and educational advisors are your best friends! I leveraged them and set up goals for myself, which helped me get this project completed. Flatiron community is great too if you get stuck ask your fellow students someone else could have solved your issue.


Some advice:
 1. Stay focused
 2. Be consistant - set up a schedule and stick to it
 3. Make sure your routes make sense - I confused myself by not being clear and       concise
 4. Style your app LAST get functionality working FIRST

Things I wish I could have done differently:
 1. To not take so long to finish this project
 2. Routes did not make sense and had more erb files than i needed
 3. Got side tracked on styling a broke a lot
