I started this project watching the CLI Walkthrough to get my outline and planning of this project off to a good start. Of course I picked the worse website to scrape. My first idea was to scrape a site that had a list of things already on the site. I thought this would be simple enough to start with...Boy, was I wrong! 

The site I had in mind had a list of games with titles but the infruastructure of this site had no HTML classes, tags were hard to strip. It was a nightmare to say the least. At times I wanted to give up altogether; so I reached out for a little help. Avi messaged me back pretty much agreeing that my site was a pain and in fact was hard to scrape, but to at it! He also helped me in the right direction for my project progress. That made me feel a little better, but after time goes by, and days turned into a week, and with no traction on this project I really started second guessing myself. I made the decison to trash the entire project and start over.

Started a clean slate:

Starting over made me realize what I could have been doing wrong in the first place. I changed my site and the subject of my project. My new idea was to have a list of best places in the world to live, once you choose the place you get the air quality of that place. Simple program but it works! :) 

The biggest challenges for me during this project was making the best decisions for my program, and second guessing myself. I kept worrying if I was going to break it or not and forcing myself to take risks while coding my program out. Once I got over that part it took one day to finally complete/wrap up this project.

I learned the most when I took chances and broke my program. Errors made me learn more about what Ruby was looking for, and our Learn community in our slack channel were most encouraging!
